##Some tiny accomplishments for which I applaud

2014 3 6 
was the most on time student of a class; 
the tutor decided for me to practicing two-handed backhand; 
was neat with the two-handed backhand; 
talked cheerfully with a new friend along the road; 
said hello to a superior who didn't recognize me; 
discussed over a project and got an idea; had some bad news but was conforted by my tender friend; 
She hugged me tight, took my hands into hers; 
discovered a nice smile while a new friend saying I'm prettier without glasses; 
felt it's good to remember the tiny things that make me happy

noticed that I was far from being attentive to others;
noticed that friends are helpful and precious all the time;
noticed that my family listens to me as friend;
noticed that I can be stronger after they all talked with me

woke up early in the morning;
hands free talked via Skype;
was efficient on picking roads;
went to a place as friend indicated;
friends' advices were helpful;
am freed from emotions;
didn't jump up during my neighbor's criticizes;
cleaned partly my place

woke up early in the morning;
a friend baked a cake for us;
my neighbors chatted with my friend;
we played ping-pong and badminton;
my friends met;
we planed to share things that we like;
all of us came back home without harm in the night;
am ready to welcome more friends at home
